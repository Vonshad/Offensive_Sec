# Enumeration Cheat Sheet
> The goal of this cheat sheet is to act as a reminder of basic enumeration steps for most common ports. Ports will be displayed in order from smallest number to biggest number.

## Port 21 - FTP
> FTP can be a useful port when combined with an HTTP server. If anonymous access is enabled, make sure to check the structure of the FTP filesystem and compare it with the HTTP server. If they are the same, look for upload permissions within the FTP server. When found, upload a revshell that would work on the web server.

#### Connect to the FTP server
> For credentials, try `anonymous` without a password. Otherwise, you will need credentials to connect.

`ftp $victim_ip`

#### Upload / Download
> Make sure that you are in binary mode when doing this. To do so, type `binary` once you are connected.

`put $filename` --> File Upload

`get $filename` --> File Download


## Port 22 - SSH
> SSH usually isn't a way in on its own. However, if you come across credentials, find a private key, or manage to inject your own public key in the victim's `authorized_keys` file, SSH can be used.

#### Connecting to SSH

`ssh USER@IP` --> Connect via user/password
